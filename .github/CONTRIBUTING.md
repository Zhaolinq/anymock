# Contributing

From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is
appreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change
the api please create an issue first. This way we can ensure that your precious
work is not in vain.

## Issues

Most of the time, if anymock is not working correctly for you, it is a simple configuration issue.

**If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/temberature/anymock/issues/new).**

## Setup

[Setup your local anymock repository](_SETUP.md)

## Submitting Changes

After getting some feedbacks, push to your fork and submit a pull request. We
may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives, but for small changes
your pull request should be accepted quickly.

Something that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* [Write tests](./test/README.md)
* Follow the existing coding style
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
